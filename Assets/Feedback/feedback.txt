I like the level design and the fact that the player is on a timer. All the mechanics seem really smooth and functional, besides one visual glitch. 
Only feedback I can give is if the player falls off the map there's no way to restart the level.

Great game so far found a few bugs with the slow time ablity it only works once and has some visual bugs when using and if you fall off the map in the first part with the
elevator where you just fall forever.

I like the mechanics of shooting targets and then move to go throught the next level. I think the ball is fast but it make a good challenge. In the first level it was hard to get
into the elevator and jump into the other platform. Good job.
