The game is really fun. I think the mechanic of aiming and shoots the target is really cool. In the first level is really 
hard to get into the moving platform because it's too small, maybe you should make it bigger?  
When I tried it, it happened to me that I was below the platform and I get hit by it and I fell. Is that intentional? 
The second level is very easy in my opinion, maybe adding like a timer that if you pass a certain time you lose or enemies (or obstacles) that make pressure on you.
