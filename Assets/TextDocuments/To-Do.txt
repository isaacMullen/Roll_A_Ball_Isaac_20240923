The game is really fun. I think the mechanic of aiming and shoots the target is really cool. In the first level is really 
hard to get into the moving platform because it's too small, maybe you should make it bigger?  
When I tried it, it happened to me that I was below the platform and I get hit by it and I fell. Is that intentional? 
The second level is very easy in my opinion, maybe adding like a timer that if you pass a certain time you lose or enemies (or obstacles) that make pressure on you.

The game is really well designed, I like the skybox and the mechanics are pretty smooth. After the elevator sequence, when you have the two targets moving back and forth, 
the higher target is much harder to hit depending on what distance you are from it.

Logan - 
really good so far shooting feels smooth the targets feel a bit too easy to hit so i would suggest makeing the targets in the second level move a bit.
the elevator has a problem for the jumping where it would seem to jump too late.
